Calculate

$$R := B^P mod \; M$$


for large values ofB,P, andMusing an efficient algorithm. (Thatâ€™s right, this problem has a time
dependency !!!.)

## Input

The input will contain several test cases, each of them as described below. Consecutive test cases are
separated by a single blank line.

Three integer values (in the orderB,P,M) will be read one number per line.BandPare integers
in the range 0 to 2147483647 inclusive.Mis an integer in the range 1 to 46340 inclusive.

## Output

For each test, the result of the computation. A single integer on a line by itself.
